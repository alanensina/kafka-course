Before to start:
- Download the last recommended version of Kafka on: https://kafka.apache.org/downloads
- Extract the .tgz
- The scripts used will be found on /bin and the configuration files are on /config

Topics:
- Topic is an Entity in Kafka with name (just like a table on databases)
- Topics are into a Kafka Broker
- Kafka Producer send a message to a topic and the Kafka Consumer will consume a message that are retained in the topic

Partitions:
- Partition is where the message lives insed the topic
- Each topic will be created with one or more partitions
- Each partition is independent of each other
- The Kafka Producer is in charge to decides which partition the message will be stored

- Usefull commands in Kafka CLI:

    auto.create.topics.enable=false
- Get in /bin on a new Terminal
- Start up the Kafka Broker: ./kafka-server-start.sh ../config/server.properties

Creating a topic, producing and consuming a message:
- Make sure that the ZooKeeper and Kafka is running
- Get in /bin on a new Terminal
- Create a topic: ./kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 4 --topic test-topic
- Instantiate a Kafka Producer (without key): ./kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic
- Type any message that you want into the terminal
- Get in /bin on a new Terminal
- Instantiate a Kafka Consumer (without key): ./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test-topic --from-beginning
